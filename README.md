# Can I use this bot for myself?
Yes. Tho we would really like to invite our already existing bot to your server you can also download its source and run it yourself.

## How do I set it up?
Download the source code
open your terminal
type
```log
cd Alphabot
npm i
```
Then open the `.env` file and get the tokens
then just type 
```log
node .
```

now the bot should start up.
generate a invite link and invite it to your server!
Your done now!

Note: This bot gets updated very frequently (once a month at least). So to always stay on the latest version you should just invite our bot:
